This site is a combination of:
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline-basic-walkthrough.html
* https://github.com/awslabs/codepipeline-nested-cfn
* my stuff

It's not really related to Wordpress (but that first website uses Wordpress for its example).
